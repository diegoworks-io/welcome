**My path / Timeline**

- Section eyebrow: My path
- Section title: The journey so far
- Lead: A through-line of design, operations, and systems thinking shaped by real work inside growing companies.

Timeline entries:

1) Period: 2013 – 2018
   - Title: Foundations in design and economics
   - Subtitle: Industrial Design + Economics
   - Details: Studied Industrial Design and Economics, learning how strategy and structure turn ideas into working organizations.

2) Period: 2019 – 2025
   - Title: Rebuilding Mexipon from the inside
   - Subtitle: Mexipon Ramen & Curry · Binational hospitality concept
   - Details:
     - Joined Mexipon Ramen & Curry, a binational hospitality concept with roots in Japan and Mexico.
     - Inherited a vision meant to scale internationally, but discovered that great ideas collapse without strong systems underneath.
     - Spent years rebuilding the company’s internal structure from the ground up: daily workflows, brand governance, project execution, and long-term planning.
     - That experience became my biggest lesson: sustainable growth depends less on ambition and more on operational clarity.

3) Period: 2023 – Present
   - Title: Business degree and system design
   - Subtitle: CETYS Universidad · Finance & Analytics track
   - Details:
     - Completing a B.A. in Business Administration focused on Finance and Analytics at CETYS Universidad.
     - Applying years of operational experience to design automation frameworks, SaaS prototypes, and system rituals that make small teams work with clarity and precision.

**Current projects / What I’m Building**

- Eyebrow: What I\'m Building
- Title: Current projects
- Lead: A personal lab for exploring what small, real-world businesses could become if they were built on clarity instead of chaos.

Project: Konbi

- Summary: Operational sandbox
- Description: Built within a fast-paced small business operating nearly around the clock. It serves as a live environment to test how structure, automation, and human rhythm can work together.
- Direct action label: Start a Konbi project
- Modal eyebrow: Live R&D for operations
- Modal description: Somewhere between a ramen shop and a research lab, Konbi is learning how small teams can work with rhythm instead of stress. It’s a living experiment in practical order: built for the space between a DIY spreadsheet and an ERP. A toolkit that shapes everyday work into patterns that can be seen, improved, and shared.
- Coming soon: Build log in progress — The full case study is coming soon. For now, you can follow the build log on Notion and LinkedIn.
- Coming soon links: Notion, LinkedIn
- What I am proving: Independent restaurants can behave like product teams when their rituals are codified, measured, and shared.
  - Bullets:
    - Shift briefs tie every station to a weekly objective.
    - Command boards expose blockers in under five minutes.
    - Experiments are logged, graded, and rolled into playbooks.
- Build log: The Konbi Planner stitches together prep logs, cash snapshots, vendor cadences, and accountability reviews. Every deliverable is battle-tested with a real crew before it ships anywhere else.
  - Bullets:
    - Planner UI prototype running via Notion + Supabase.
    - Automation scripts send recap emails after each close.
    - Weekly operations review pulls metrics straight from the planner.
- How to engage: I work with founders and GMs who want the same clarity. Bring me in for a systems audit, a standing advisory seat, or to co-build your first internal ops product.
  - Bullets:
    - Limited advisory seats per quarter.
    - On-site intensives available in Baja & Southern California.
    - Confidential work is documented with anonymized patterns.
- Roadmap (Konbi):
  - Q2 · Planner instrumentation — Shift rituals become structured, queryable data.
  - Q3 · Automation pilots — Connect prep, staffing, and procurement dashboards.
  - Q4 · Public release — Publish the Konbi Planner framework + implementation kit.
- CTA title: Partner with Konbi
  - Body: Need to turn a craft-driven operation into a predictable system? Let’s architect it together.
  - Primary label: Start a Konbi project
  - Secondary label: Request the Konbi Planner outline

Project: Boki

- Summary: Field intelligence
- Description: A lightweight digital counter for analog environments. Captures field data simply and reliably, bridging physical operations with digital reporting. Preparing its first public release and pricing model.
- Direct action label: Sign up for the Boki pilot
- Modal eyebrow: Field intelligence
- Modal description: Boki is a digital counter for small teams. It records every count in a clean, structured database that you can export, visualize, or print. Use it on mobile or desktop to track what matters. Boki turns everyday counting into reliable data you can use to make decisions.
- Coming soon: Pilot notes coming soon — Pilot notes are on the way. For now, follow the latest build reports on Notion and LinkedIn.
- Why build Boki: Most counting apps feel like spreadsheets. Boki is tactile—big targets, haptic feedback, and offline resilience. It lets teams trust their numbers without learning a new system.
  - Bullets:
    - Designed for wet hands, gloves, and quick thumb input.
    - Offline-first sync so rural kitchens are never blocked.
    - Event log links every count to a person, time, and location.
- What is live today: The prototype is shipping with a React Native shell, Supabase sync, and a calibration suite that keeps hardware honest.
  - Bullets:
    - Hardware telemetry feeding into Supabase Realtime.
    - Role-based access so franchisees see only their operations.
    - First ten beta partners onboarded for usability reviews.
- How to support it: You can join the waitlist, pre-purchase units for your team, or fund a feature that serves your workflow.
  - Bullets:
    - Funding tiers unlock custom sensor integrations.
    - Advisory sessions available for field rollout planning.
    - Every supporter receives lifetime access to the build log.
- Roadmap (Boki):
  - Pilot · Mobile counter — Polish the single-thumb experience + offline queue.
  - Beta · Shared dashboards — Give managers live feeds of counts + anomalies.
  - Launch · Pricing + hardware kits — Bundle SaaS with purpose-built enclosures.
